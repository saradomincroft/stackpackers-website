            Stackpackers are a storm in full force. This cheeky duo shares a
            chemistry that&apos;s electric, unpredictable, and experimental.
            Blending old and new, their sets are a freestyle, ever-changing
            journey. With drum & bass at the heart of their sound, Stackpackers
            have made their mark with amped-up, power-packed DnB sets that keep
            the dance floor charged. However, it&apos;s not all thunder and
            lightning â€“ they know exactly when to bring it down with emotional,
            moody liquid, proving they&apos;re as versatile as they are energetic.
            <br />
            <br />
            In the production space, their tracks have found a home with those
            who seek unfiltered chaos and a fresh take on the underground sound.
